Word Pool
=========

A browser-based game of word searching.

Go to [ianb.github.com/wordpool](http://ianb.github.com/wordpool) to
play.

To Play
=======

There will be many letters arranged on the page.  Draw a square around
the letters to make a valid word (the order of the letters doesn't
matter).

You'll get a score for the length of the word and the size of the
square.

Hit "shuffle" to get new letters.  Check the "Hint?" checkbox if you
want the game to tell you when you've enclosed the letters to make a
valid word.
